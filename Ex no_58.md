# EX 58 C Function to display queue elements using Linked List.(use integer data in the queue)
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a C Function to display queue elements using Linked List.

## Algorithm
1. Start
2. Define a structure Node with two fields:
      * data (integer type)
      * next (pointer to the next node)
3. Initialize front and rear pointers:
      * front points to the first node in the queue
      * rear points to the last node in the queue
4. Check if front is NULL:
      * If NULL, print "Queue is empty" and exit. 
5.Otherwise, create a temporary pointer temp pointing to front.

6. Loop through the queue:
      * Print temp->data.
      * Move temp to temp->next.
7. Continue until temp becomes NULL.
8. End

This algorithm efficiently traverses and prints all queue elements using a linked list. Want a full implementation with enqueue and dequeue functions? ðŸš€

```
struct Node
{
   float data;
   struct Node *next;
}*front=NULL,*rear=NULL;
void display()
{
    struct Node *ptr;
    ptr=front;
    if(front==NULL)
    {
        printf("queue is empty");
        
    }
    else
    {printf("Queue elements:\n");
    while(ptr!=0)
    {
        printf("%.3f\n",ptr->data);
        ptr=ptr->next;
    }}
}
```

## Output:

## Result:
Thus the program was executed and the output was verified successfully.
